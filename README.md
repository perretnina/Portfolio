# Portfolio - Nina Perret

This portfolio showcases a selection of my academic and personal projects completed during my engineering studies at Lycée du Parc and at Mines Saint-Etienne. 
They highlight my skills in **embedded systems, cryptography, prototyping, data analysis and applied computer science**, combining both theoretical analysis and hands-on implementation.  


## [ASCON – SystemVerilog Implementation](./ASCON)
- Completed in April/May 2025 as part of the *Digital System Design* course at Mines Saint-Étienne  
- Designed RTL modules and corresponding testbenches  
- Authored a report combining theoretical analysis and practical implementation 

## [Bluetooth Robot – STM32](./Robot)
- Completed in June 2025 as part of the *Robot Project* course at Mines Saint-Étienne
- Developed embedded C code on STM32 microcontroller
- Controlled the robot via Bluetooth from a smartphone: send commands to move forward, turn, or stop  

## [TIPE – Supervised Personal Research Project: Bicycle Helmets and Non-Newtonian Materials](./TIPE)
- Conducted from March 2023 to June 2024 as part of the French competitive entrance exams for engineering schools, presented to a jury in July 2024
- Carried out bibliographic research, summarized in the MCOT report 
- Designed and conducted concrete experiments  
- Oral defense supported by a presentation deck
- Python code for processing experimental data   

## [Prototyping Project – Conditioning Circuit](./Prototypage)
- Completed in May/June 2025 as part of the *Prototyping Project* course at Mines Saint-Étienne  
- Designed schematics and routed a conditioning circuit in KiCad  
- Applied to a real-world device using capacitive sensing and actuators to discourage phone use and reduce distractions during study sessions

## [Internship Report – EDF](./Internship)
- Conducted in January 2025 within the Geotechnical Engineering Department (TEGG)
- Developed a Python program to analyze soil settlement beneath French nuclear power facilities
- Processed over 50,000 records to extract, clean, and visualize geotechnical data
- Due to confidentiality, the original Python scripts and raw data cannot be shared. This folder contains the internship report summarizing the work carried out.
