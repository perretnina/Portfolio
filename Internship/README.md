# Internship Report â€“ EDF

This folder contains the deliverables of my internship at **EDF** (January 2025),  
conducted within the **Geotechnical Engineering Department (TEGG)** in Aix-en-Provence.  

During this internship, I enhanced an existing Python program developed by my supervisor.  
The work was divided into two main tasks: **post-processing** and **pre-processing** of geotechnical data.  

Key contributions:  
- Automated **post-processing** by generating analyzable graphs, comparison tables, and extrapolation curves to forecast soil settlement.  
- Automated **pre-processing** by concatenating, cleaning, and standardizing raw data from Excel files.  
- Processed over **50,000 data records** across ten nuclear facilities, producing graphs for three key parameters: **vertical settlement, tilting, and dip**.  

Files included:  
- Internship report: extended version in French and shortened version in English
- Due to confidentiality, the original Python scripts and raw data cannot be shared.
