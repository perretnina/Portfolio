# Prototyping Project – Conditioning Circuit

This folder contains the deliverables of the Prototyping Project completed in May/June 2025 as part of the *Prototyping Project* course at Mines Saint-Étienne.  
The work focused on designing and routing a conditioning circuit in **KiCad**, applied to a device using **capacitive sensing and actuators** to discourage phone use and reduce distractions during study sessions.  

Files included:  
- Circuit schematics and PCB layout (KiCad files)  
- Project report (PDF)
- 3D render screenshots of the circuit (images)
